# Create Probot App

This project will generate a new [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) app
with everything you need to get started building. 👷🏽‍

In particular, this command line interface allows you to select from our pre-defined blue prints to choose a basic working example to start from.

```sh
npx create-probot-app my-first-app
```

If you're using Yarn:

```sh
yarn create probot-app my-first-app
```

See the [Probot docs](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#running-the-app-locally) to get started running your app locally.
