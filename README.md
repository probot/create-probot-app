# Create Probot App

[![CI](https://github.com/probot/create-probot-app/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/probot/create-probot-app/actions)

`create-probot-app` is a _command line_ (CLI) Node.js application that generates a new [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) app with everything you need to get started building. üë∑üèΩ‚Äç

More specifically, this command line interface allows you to select from our pre-defined blue prints to choose a basic working example to start from.

## Installation

Make sure you've got [Node.js installed](https://Node.js.org/en/download/) on your workstation, than open your terminal and type the following command:

- if you're using `npm` (the package manager bundled with `Node.js`):

    ```sh
    npx create-probot-app my-first-app
    ```

- if you're using Yarn:

    ```sh
    yarn create probot-app my-first-app
    ```

and follow the instructions printed on the terminal as you go. `create-probot-app` will then take care of the heavy lifting required to setup a Probot app development environment, with proper folder structure, and even installing all the basic `Probot` dependencies.

## How to run locally

See the [Probot docs](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#running-the-app-locally) to get started running your app locally.
